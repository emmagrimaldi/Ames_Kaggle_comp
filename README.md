# Ames_Kaggle_comp

This notebook contains my machine learning model to predict the price of a house in Ames, Iowa.
The model, a Lasso regression, is trained by using a dataframe of few thousands rows.
The notebok also provides a
detailed EDA (all the plots are in the 'presentation images' folder), as well as all the methods used to fill out the empty spaces in the dataframe.
